I am a complete and utter geek. I'm a Cyber Security student at RGU in Aberdeen, UK and aspiring Cyber Consultant, Keynote Speaker and Entrepreneur with an interest in anything Cyber or computing Infrastructure related.

I spend some of my time setting up and running my cluster of Raspberry Pi's and other old computers as I learn about clusterisation, containers and system administration. This website in fact is run off that cluster. I am also looking at starting a Container as a Service hosting company to put some of my knowledge into production however this wont be launched until March 2026

If you are interested in anything I'm doing ping me a message by [email](mailto:ping@cloudforestcyber.co.uk) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfie-ford-ccs/)
